<h3>Why did I start uploading the solutions to Github? </h3>
Well my friend wanted help in understanding a concept and I did not have my laptop with me. That is when I felt the need to have my solutions posted somewhere for my reference 

<h3>Why check out the repo?</h3>
Mainly because it is not perfect! I am not tourist or Raj to solve complex problems without any help. And unless, you are someone like me, I am confident that you will find this repo useful in your DSA journey.

<h2> A brief about me because why not?</h2>
